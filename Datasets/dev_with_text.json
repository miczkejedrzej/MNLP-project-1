However, the purview of the office under the two dynasties differed markedly. Under the Ming dynasty, the post originated around 1430 as a kind of inspector-general and ad hoc provincial-level administrator; such a xunfu is usually translated as a grand coordinator. However, since the mid-17th century, xunfu became the title of a regular provincial governor overseeing civil administration in the Qing dynasty.\nUnder both dynasties, the xunfu was subordinate in military affairs to the multi-provincial zongdu (\u7e3d\u7763), usually translated as \"supreme commander\" under the Ming and \"governor-general\" or \"viceroy\" under the Qing.\nThe Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty of Vietnam also established the position (known as tu\u1ea7n ph\u1ee7 or tu\u1ea7n v\u0169 \u5de1\u64ab) based on the contemporaneous position of Qing China.\n\n\n== Ming grand coordinator ==\nThe \"grand coordinator\" of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131"}

His family had been well-known since the early 17th century, coming from the szlachta, although grown poor so both of his parents had to work as tenant farmers at the folwark. Yanka\u2019s grandfather leased the land from the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family who eventually expelled him from his home. The story later formed the basis of Kupala\u2019s drama \u2018The Ravaged Nest\u2019. Young Ivan had to help his father support the family. When his father died in 1902 he became the only provider. He worked a variety of short-term jobs, including as a tutor, a shop assistant, and a record keeper. Later he was hired as a labourer at the local distillery.
